\section{Introduction}

Our client, a credit institution that provides financial aid to students, want to expand their customer base but would also like that most of the loans be payed back. Our role as the analyst is to use the publicly available [College Scoreboard Datasets](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/) to figure out what features of a college make it more reliable for credit. Our team will be using the 3 year repayment rate as am indicator of the school's overall reliability rate. Using exploratory data analysis we will examine the relationships between repayment rate and other features of the school. In our analysis, we will use ridge, lasso, partial least squares, and principle component regression to find significant features that influence a school's overall repayment rate.
