\section{Methods}

The data that we use for the analysis contains 7703 universitites under 1743 different categories. In order to analyze the data more efficiently, our team decided to remove all the columns that doesn't have sufficient data; we considered the columns as insufficient if 99 percent or more of the column values are NA(see 000.R file for cleaning but is not necessary to reproduce the project). After this process, we decreased the number of the columns to about 500. After the first round of cleaning, the team went through all the columns by each category that are related to client's profile. List of the variables can be found under data\_cleaning\_script.R file. After we obtained specific list of column names, we converted all the NULL values and PrivacySuppressed to NA. After removing Null and PrivacySuppressed values, we removed all columns with at at most 50% NULL and replaced reamining NA values with column mean, in order to 
performed correlation matrices to see which predictors have high correlation between 3yr repayment rate. Since all of the repayment rate has high correlation with 3yr repayment rate, we took out rest of the repayment rate columns and picked variables that has higher absolute value of 0.5 correlation coefficient. With specified variables, we ran basic ols regression to see which variables to and which to clean out.

After ols, we removed variables with greater than 0.05 pvalue produced clean data as csv file under clean\_data folder.
