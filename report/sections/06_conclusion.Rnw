\section{Conclusions}

In this report, we analyzed how repayment rates on federal student loans varied as a result of several factors. We analyzed how federal student loan repayment rates vary between public and private schools, between regions, and between colleges with differing tuition costs and completion rates. In addition, we used regression and time series analysis to predict which colleges will likely have high private loan repayment rates, and which colleges have an upward trend in repayment rates - information valuable to a customer such as ours.

Our regressions indicated that our client should pay closest attention to student completion rates, as these were the best predictor of repayment on federal loans for both four-year and less-than-four-year institutions. In addition, our regression analysis showed certain features of postgraduate income to be a good predictor of repayment. Specifically, while average postgraduate income was a poor predictor of repayment rates, we found that the share of students earning over \$25000 per year was a good predictor of repayment. From this information, it is reasonable to conclude that students earning over a certain cost-of-living threshold will be much more likely to pay back their loans than students making less, but that loan repayment rates are somewhat steady above a certain threshold. While we do not have the student-by-student data to verify this, we can recommend that our client focus not on average postgraduate income but on the percentage of graduates making above a \"Living Wage\".

Finally, we performed time series analysis to determine which schools are likely to have the highest future repayment rates, based on their past and current rates over six years. We created a list of top 100 colleges by predicted future repayment rates - our client can use this list to identify schools that are likely to well better in the future, in order to shift their efforts to those schools.
